# PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC EXEMPT 506-C OFFERING
The 506-C is an exempt offering from SEC registration (requires notification on SEC EDGAR) but is regulated
by the each state security laws.

The latest 506-C notification is available at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766947/000176694722000005/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml

While the original intention is make the exempt offering available as a private sale on OPENSEA.IO at https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/36333753202514414869774196218446368102124864803313914227828195911338163275424,
which maintains the exclusiveness and safe harbor compliance for an exempt offering, the private NFT sale does not allow resells when after the minimum holding period as an unrstricted security or even sales among accredited investors or resells when the security becomes unrestricted after the holding period.

Using the smart contract repository at https://github.com/pingleware/pingleware-contracts, a modified 506-C smart contact would need to be created and published on OPENSEA.IO that permits whitelisting initial accredited investors, changing an accredited investor holdings to
unrestricted after the holding time has elapsed, permit resells of unregistered securities.

Use of the smart contract for a 506-C exempt offering will maintain safe harbor compliance and 
offer automatic liquidity to the initial accredited investors after their holding time has elapsed.

Deploying the smart contract to the ethereum mainnet and listing on OPENSEA.IO provides an established customer based for increased liquidity.
